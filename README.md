# A Basic Compiler For Pseudocode

My implementation of a fully functional compiler to make the IGCSE / A Level Computer Science language Pseuedocode executable on any machine. The compiler consists of a hand-built lexer, parser and code generator. Code generation creates valid Python code for users to study and find relationships between pseudocode and Python. 

I hope it can help people who really struggled to learn the pseudocode syntax like I did. 

## Usage 
1. Download binary for either Linux or Windows
2. Run using command ./ppc \[your_file.pcode]
3. Output file will be your_file.py
4. (Optional) Add downloaded binary to your path if you want to run ppc from anywhere

Example pseudocode files can be found in the data folder. Have fun and try writing your own!
