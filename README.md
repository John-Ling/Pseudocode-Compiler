# Building-A-Compiler

My implementation of a fully functional compiler to make the IGCSE / A Level Computer Science language Pseuedocode executable on any machine. The compiler consists of a hand-built lexer, parser and code generator (glossing over details for brevity). Code generation creates valid Python code for users to study and find relationships between pseudocode and Python. 

Should this project succeed, I hope it can help people who really struggled to learn the pseudocode syntax like I did.
